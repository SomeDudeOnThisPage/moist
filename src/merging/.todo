- merge a submesh into a bigger overall mesh file by identifying identical vertices.
- meshes need to have conforming "interface-planes", meaning the same vertices and edges between them... validate this somehow?
- need some form of metadata for this... customuize .mesh format... spatial... don't want to load entire file...
- per-vertex attributes are likely too memory intensive/unneccessary...
