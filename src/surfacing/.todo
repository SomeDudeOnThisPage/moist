- extract isosurface(s) from binarized (or discretized) volume
- extract slice by slice, make parallelizable - must make sure interface planes exist and are "flat"
- ideally adapt a ready-made algorithm, have to check what exists...
- can use "suboptimal" algorithms that generate non-watertight, non-manifold or self-intersecting meshes
- some form of dual contouring to make "less interesting" areas of the mesh coarser? -> use sizing field for this somehow?
